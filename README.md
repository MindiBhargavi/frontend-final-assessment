# Sales Dashboard using Next.js

## 🎯 Project Objective

The goal of this project is to build a basic frontend dashboard using Next.js that displays sales data for multiple years in a visual format (charts).
This demonstrates:

- Component-based design
- Dashboard creation
- Chart integration
- Use of modern frontend tools

## 🧱 Project Architecture (Atomic / Component-Based)

Your project follows a component-based (atomic) structure, which means:

- Pages handle layout and routing
- Components handle reusable UI elements (like charts)

Example:

- Dashboard Page → container
- SalesChart Component → reusable visual unit

This is exactly what the assessment asked for.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack Used

- Next.js 13 (App Router) – frontend framework
- TypeScript – type-safe JavaScript
- Tailwind CSS – utility-first styling
- Recharts – charting library
- React Components – modular UI structure

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000/dashboard](http://localhost:3000/dashboard) with your browser to see the sales dashboard.
